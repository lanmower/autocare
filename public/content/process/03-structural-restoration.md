# Structural Restoration

The structural restoration phase is the foundation upon which all other restoration work depends. This critical stage addresses the fundamental integrity of your vehicle, ensuring that every structural component meets or exceeds original specifications for safety, performance, and longevity.

## Comprehensive Structural Assessment

Before any restoration work begins, our certified technicians perform an exhaustive structural analysis using advanced measurement systems and time-tested inspection techniques. This assessment identifies all areas requiring attention, from obvious damage to hidden deterioration.

### Advanced Diagnostic Techniques:

**Precision Measurement Systems**
- Computerized frame measurement and alignment verification
- Laser measurement for dimensional accuracy
- Reference point comparison against manufacturer specifications
- Documentation of any deviations from original geometry

**Corrosion Detection and Analysis**
- Ultrasonic thickness testing to identify hidden rust
- Moisture detection in enclosed areas
- Assessment of rust progression and structural impact
- Evaluation of previous repair attempts and their effectiveness

## Metal Replacement and Fabrication

When structural components are beyond repair, our skilled craftsmen utilize both traditional techniques and modern technology to restore your vehicle's structural integrity.

### Replacement Procedures:

**Precision Cutting and Removal**
- Surgical removal of compromised sections
- Preservation of surrounding undamaged areas
- Clean, precise cuts that facilitate proper welding
- Documentation of all replacement areas for reference

**Custom Fabrication**
- Hand-formed replacement sections using traditional English wheels
- CNC-cut patterns for complex shapes and curves
- Material selection matching original specifications
- Test fitting before final installation

**Professional Welding Techniques**
- TIG welding for precision joints and minimal heat input
- MIG welding for structural strength and efficiency
- Proper joint preparation and fit-up procedures
- Post-weld treatment and finishing

## Corrosion Treatment and Prevention

Rust is the enemy of every classic vehicle, and our comprehensive approach to corrosion treatment goes far beyond simple surface preparation. We employ industry-leading techniques to not only remove existing corrosion but also prevent its return.

### Multi-Stage Corrosion Treatment:

**Complete Rust Removal**
- Media blasting to remove all traces of corrosion
- Chemical treatment of pitted surfaces
- Electrochemical rust conversion where appropriate
- Thorough cleaning and decontamination

**Surface Preparation**
- Proper metal conditioning for optimal adhesion
- Phosphate treatment for corrosion resistance
- Surface profile optimization for coating adhesion
- Quality control inspection at each stage

**Protective Coating Systems**
- High-performance primer application
- Cavity wax injection for enclosed areas
- Seam sealing to prevent moisture intrusion
- Long-term corrosion protection strategies

## Structural Alignment and Geometry

Proper alignment is crucial for vehicle safety, handling, and tire wear. Our restoration process includes comprehensive alignment verification and correction to ensure your vehicle tracks straight and true.

### Alignment Procedures:

**Frame and Unibody Correction**
- Hydraulic straightening using certified equipment
- Heat application when appropriate for stress relief
- Progressive correction to avoid over-stressing materials
- Continuous monitoring during correction process

**Suspension Mounting Points**
- Verification of control arm mounting locations
- Shock tower alignment and reinforcement
- Steering box and rack mounting verification
- Wheel alignment geometry restoration

**Quality Verification**
- Final dimensional inspection against specifications
- Road test evaluation of tracking and handling
- Tire wear pattern analysis
- Long-term monitoring and adjustment as needed

## Structural Reinforcement

Where appropriate, we incorporate structural reinforcements that enhance the vehicle's integrity while maintaining its original appearance and character.

### Reinforcement Techniques:
- Strategic placement of additional material in stress areas
- Boxing of open frame sections for increased rigidity
- Gusset installation at critical joint locations
- Modern materials integration with traditional construction

This comprehensive structural restoration ensures that your vehicle's foundation is solid, safe, and built to last for generations of enjoyment. Every weld, every joint, and every structural component is restored with the precision and attention to detail that your classic automobile deserves.
