# Panel Work & Fabrication

The art of panel work and fabrication represents the intersection of traditional craftsmanship and modern precision. Our master panel beaters combine time-honored techniques with cutting-edge technology to create body panels that match original specifications exactly, whether repairing existing components or fabricating entirely new sections.

## Traditional Panel Beating Techniques

Our craftsmen are trained in the classical art of panel beating, utilizing techniques that have been refined over generations of automotive restoration. These traditional methods ensure authentic results that maintain the character and integrity of your vehicle.

### Hand-Forming Methods:

**English Wheel Shaping**
- Gradual metal stretching and forming using traditional English wheels
- Precise control over metal flow and panel curvature
- Maintenance of proper metal thickness throughout the forming process
- Creation of complex compound curves that match original specifications

**Hammer and Dolly Work**
- Strategic metal manipulation using specialized hammers and dollies
- Careful attention to work-hardening and metal fatigue
- Progressive shaping from rough form to final finish
- Preservation of original panel character and surface quality

**Planishing and Finishing**
- Final surface refinement using planishing hammers
- Elimination of tool marks and surface imperfections
- Achievement of smooth, consistent panel surfaces
- Preparation for primer and paint application

## Advanced Fabrication Capabilities

When original panels are unavailable or beyond repair, our fabrication department creates exact reproductions using a combination of traditional techniques and modern technology.

### Custom Fabrication Process:

**Pattern Development**
- Creation of accurate templates from existing panels or technical drawings
- Digital scanning and CAD modeling for complex shapes
- Test fitting and refinement of patterns before final fabrication
- Documentation of all patterns for future reference

**Material Selection and Preparation**
- Sourcing of appropriate gauge steel matching original specifications
- Quality verification of material composition and properties
- Proper cutting and edge preparation for forming operations
- Surface treatment and cleaning before fabrication begins

**Precision Forming Operations**
- CNC cutting for accurate pattern replication
- Progressive forming using hydraulic presses and specialized dies
- Hand-finishing to achieve final dimensions and surface quality
- Multiple test fittings throughout the fabrication process

## Panel Repair and Restoration

Not all damaged panels require complete replacement. Our skilled technicians excel at restoring original panels, preserving as much of the original material as possible while achieving like-new results.

### Repair Techniques:

**Dent Removal and Reshaping**
- Paintless dent repair for minor damage preservation
- Traditional bodywork techniques for major damage restoration
- Heat application and stress relief for severely damaged areas
- Careful attention to maintaining original panel thickness

**Section Replacement**
- Strategic replacement of damaged sections while preserving undamaged areas
- Precise cutting and welding techniques to minimize distortion
- Proper heat management during welding operations
- Seamless integration of new material with existing panels

**Edge and Flange Restoration**
- Reformation of damaged flanges and mounting edges
- Restoration of proper clearances and alignment points
- Recreation of original spot weld patterns and locations
- Verification of proper door, hood, and trunk gaps

## Fitment and Alignment Verification

Perfect panel fitment is the hallmark of quality restoration work. Our meticulous approach to alignment ensures that every panel fits exactly as it did when the vehicle left the factory.

### Alignment Procedures:

**Gap and Flush Verification**
- Precise measurement of panel gaps using specialized gauges
- Verification of flush alignment between adjacent panels
- Correction of any deviations from factory specifications
- Documentation of all alignment measurements

**Functional Testing**
- Operation verification for doors, hoods, and trunk lids
- Testing of latch engagement and closing effort
- Verification of window and seal alignment
- Adjustment of hinges and latches as necessary

**Final Quality Inspection**
- Visual inspection under various lighting conditions
- Tactile inspection for surface smoothness and consistency
- Verification of all mounting points and hardware
- Sign-off approval before proceeding to surface preparation

## Preparation for Refinishing

Once panel work is complete, each component undergoes thorough preparation to ensure optimal adhesion and finish quality for the refinishing stage.

### Pre-Refinishing Preparation:
- Complete cleaning and decontamination of all surfaces
- Final surface inspection and correction of any imperfections
- Application of appropriate primer systems
- Protection of completed panels during storage

This comprehensive approach to panel work and fabrication ensures that every body panel meets the highest standards of quality, fitment, and authenticity. Whether repairing original components or creating exact reproductions, our craftsmen deliver results that honor the original design while providing modern durability and longevity.
