# Initial Assessment

The foundation of every successful restoration project begins with a thorough and comprehensive initial assessment. This critical first step sets the tone for the entire restoration process and ensures that no detail is overlooked.

## Comprehensive Vehicle Evaluation

Our experienced team conducts a meticulous inspection of your vehicle, examining every component from the structural integrity of the frame to the smallest cosmetic details. We utilize advanced diagnostic tools and decades of hands-on experience to identify all areas requiring attention.

### What We Examine:

- **Structural Integrity**: Frame condition, alignment, and any structural damage
- **Body Panels**: Rust, dents, scratches, and overall condition assessment
- **Mechanical Components**: Engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems
- **Interior Elements**: Upholstery, dashboard, trim pieces, and functionality
- **Paint and Finish**: Current paint condition, color matching requirements, and surface preparation needs

## Detailed Documentation Process

Every aspect of your vehicle's condition is carefully documented with high-resolution photographs, detailed notes, and condition reports. This comprehensive documentation serves multiple purposes:

- Creates a baseline reference for the restoration work
- Helps identify original specifications and factory details
- Assists in sourcing appropriate parts and materials
- Provides transparency throughout the restoration process

## Custom Restoration Planning

Based on our thorough assessment, we develop a customized restoration plan tailored specifically to your vehicle and your goals. This plan includes:

### Project Scope Definition
- Prioritization of restoration tasks
- Timeline estimates for each phase
- Budget considerations and cost breakdowns
- Parts sourcing and availability assessment

### Quality Standards
- Establishment of restoration quality levels (concours, driver quality, etc.)
- Material specifications and sourcing requirements
- Finish standards and expectations
- Documentation of any custom modifications or special requests

## Client Consultation and Approval

We believe in complete transparency and client involvement throughout the process. During the assessment phase, we:

- Provide detailed explanations of all findings
- Discuss restoration options and alternatives
- Present cost estimates and timelines
- Address any questions or concerns
- Obtain client approval before proceeding

This thorough initial assessment ensures that your restoration project starts on solid ground, with clear expectations, realistic timelines, and a comprehensive understanding of the work required to bring your vehicle back to its former glory.
