# 1967 Mustang Fastback - Classic Restoration

## Project Overview

This remarkable 1967 Mustang Fastback came to us in need of a complete frame-off restoration. As one of the most iconic American muscle cars of all time, this project represented both a significant challenge and an incredible opportunity to showcase our expertise in classic vehicle restoration.

## Initial Assessment

The vehicle arrived with decades of wear, rust damage, and previous repair attempts that needed to be addressed. Our initial assessment revealed:

- Extensive surface rust throughout the body panels
- Compromised structural integrity in key areas
- Original drivetrain components requiring complete rebuilding
- Interior components needing full restoration or replacement
- Paint system that had deteriorated beyond repair

## Restoration Process

### Frame-Off Restoration Approach

We began with a complete disassembly of the vehicle, carefully cataloging every component. The body was separated from the frame, allowing us to address both the structural elements and body panels with the precision they deserved.

### Structural Work

- Complete frame restoration with rust remediation
- Replacement of compromised metal sections
- Reinforcement of stress points to factory specifications
- Application of modern protective coatings for longevity

### Body Panel Restoration

Our master craftsmen addressed each panel individually:

- Hand-formed replacement sections where original metal was beyond repair
- Meticulous rust treatment and preparation
- Traditional panel beating techniques to restore original contours
- Custom fabrication of hard-to-find components

### Mechanical Restoration

The drivetrain received a complete rebuild:

- Engine block restored to factory specifications
- Transmission and differential overhaul
- Suspension components replaced with period-correct parts
- Brake system upgraded while maintaining original appearance

### Refinishing Excellence

The final paint system represents our commitment to concours-level quality:

- Multiple stages of primer and blocking
- Color-matched factory-correct paint
- Show-quality wet sanding and polishing
- Protective clear coat application

## Results

The completed restoration transformed this classic Mustang into a stunning example of American automotive history. Every detail was attended to with the care and precision that these iconic vehicles deserve. The result is a vehicle that not only looks spectacular but maintains the authentic driving experience that makes classic Mustangs so special.
